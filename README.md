# Password-Generator
A safe password generator you can run in the terminal. You can set the password length to your desired amount and control if there is symbols or not. The symbols include symbols that arent typically in brute-force dictionaries (±, æ, ¶, £, ∞) and can generate passwords that would take over the life of the universe to crack.
